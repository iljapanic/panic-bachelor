## 5. Analysis

As stated in the outset of this paper, the tourism industry is one the most impacted by the recent rapid advances in the technology. The Internet increasingly mediates the travelling experience (Xiang, & Gretzel, 2010). While in the past the brands owned the sense of quality (Vanderbilt, 2015), now it is the digital word-of-mouth that decides where people go to eat, sleep and entertain themselves when on the road (Xiang, & Gretzel, 2010).

This section starts off with examining current solution to the information problem posed by travelling and then moves onto a close analyses of information seeking behavior in this context.

## 5.1 Current solutions

In this part of the analyses, the current solutions for information seeking support are analyzed. Before moving onto the examination of the individual services, here is a list of abbreviations used in this part of the paper:

- **T2T** - traveler to traveler
- **T2L** - traveler to local
- **L2T** - local to traveler
- **B2T** - business to traveler
- **T2B** - traveler to business

**Paper guidebook (B2T)**

strong bias (business paying to be featured)
great source for general info about the country, local culture and manners


**TripAdvisor (T2T, B2T)**

feedback systems susceptible to manipulation (Smyth, Wu, & Greene 2010)
curated by algorithm, which is secretive and non-transparent (Vanderbilt, 2015)
menu-driven interface
“loads of info, but no insight” (Vanderbilt, 2015)

### 5.2 Information-seeking in the travel

humans are still the best curators (human-scale)
search is a dominant mode of finding information
search engines (Google Search) are the gatekeepers, and serve as an entry point to other services
environmental constraints: time of the year, weather, physical access
economical constrains: budget
