## 6. Conclusion
 


#### Tapping into wisdom of crowds

* trust building in a virtual environment (A12)
* simplistic model of motivation (B3:92) -> works fairly well for traditional economy not so much information economy
* social production
* local residents have implicit knowledge of surroundings
* commons based peer production like Wikipedia


#### Business Model
- gamification, ranking systems
- potential for monetization:
	- charge companies to make accounts (sponsored lists), individual always free
	- create an internal market, where companies motivate opinion leaders to mention them on their list
