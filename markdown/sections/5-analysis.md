## 5. Analysis
As stated in the outset of this paper, the tourism industry has been one of  the most impacted by the proliferation of ubiquitous Internet access. The Internet technology increasingly mediates the traveling experience (Xiang, & Gretzel, 2010). While in the past the brands and travel agencies owned the sense of quality, now it is the digital word-of-mouth that decides where people go to eat, sleep and entertain themselves when on the road (Vanderbilt, 2015; Xiang, & Gretzel, 2010).

To guide the analysis, the following research question has been devised (as stated in the Introduction). 

*How to provide travelers with location-based information through harnessing collective knowledge of local residents by applying principles of information design?* 

The analysis follows a DSRM as outlined in the previous section. The analysis starts off by identifying problems with some of the current solutions. Using the models presented in the conceptual framework, the second sub-section aims to uncover some of the information behavior patterns in the traveling context and infer characteristic of an information system that would support these patterns. The analysis concludes by proposing an information system solution that addresses the information problem posed by traveling.


### 5.1 Current solutions
There is no shortage of services and tools that claim to help travelers find useful information, and provide an insight into a local culture. However, from the collected data it was apparent that there are a few prevalent sources of information that people use when they are visiting a foreign country. Following is an analysis of problematic aspects of some of those sources.

#### Search engines (Google)
Google is a dominant source of travel-related information for majority of people (Xiang, & Gretzel, 2010). Several respondents from the survey indicated that they use Google to get a general overview of the location they are traveling to. However, some of those respondents also mentioned that they find Google unsuitable for finding a more specialized and personalized type of information. This information source can be described as **many-to-traveler**, since there is no predominant group that provides the information (if we omit paid search results). Google supports exploratory type of travel research and is a good starting point, but in the words of one of the respondents: “[the] results can be quite overwhelming”.

#### Paper guidebook
A traditional source for travel-related information. Its main advantage is a comprehensive overview of the country’s landmarks, culture, gastronomy, and local manners. However, guidebooks can quickly get outdated due to the limitations of the paper as a medium. This source can be described as **business-to-traveler**, since it is created by a company. This increases a chance of biased content, since other organizations can pay to be included, or prioritized in the guidebook.

#### TripAdvisor
One of the most widely used services for looking up reviews and ratings for restaurants and hotels. It is primarily a **traveler-to-traveler** source. This may result in a diluted type of information, because the majority of the user-generated content is created by tourists, not locals, who are more familiar with genuinely local attractions. Their feedback systems are susceptible to manipulation with a possibility to buy bogus reviews online (Smyth, Wu, & Greene 2010). The interface is menu-driven and the content on the service is curated by an algorithm that is secretive and non-transparent (Vanderbilt, 2015). The service's main advantage is the diversity of opinions and reviews lowering the overall bias. But since the reviews and ratings are bound to a single, isolated attraction, the service runs into a trouble of generating “loads of info, but no insight” (Vanderbilt, 2015).

#### CouchSurfing
The service is not officially portrayed as a travel-related information source. Yet, it provides a **local-to-traveler** type of information exchange, which provides the traveler with most authentic information. However, this exchange happens exclusively through face-to-face communication. The online service serves only as mediator, helping travelers establish a contact with a local host. It does not produce, nor capture any travel-related information artifacts for future reference for other travelers.


### 5.2 Information seeking and traveling
As mentioned earlier, online search using Google is the prevalent method of information seeking behavior when traveling. It is followed by asking someone that is familiar with the country the traveler is planning to visit. Some respondents prefer to use paper guidebooks, mostly in combination with some of the other methods. From the respondents’ answers it was apparent that people value opinions of other people more highly than they value ratings, rankings, and other forms of algorithm-based metrics. This sub-section of the analysis applies the models presented in the conceptual framework to infer characteristics of a potential IS solution that addresses information problems in a traveling context.


#### Dervin’s Sense-Making Framework ####
Derwin’s Sense-Making framework is used to situate the traveler in time and space and identify means of resolving information problems they face in relation to the outcomes they expect to achieve. The first situation occurs in traveler’s home country, when they first find out they are going to travel to a foreign country. It is at this point where first information problems arise. Travelers have to ask themselves questions like:

- Where am I going to stay?
- How am I going to get there?
- How much money do I need to take with me?
- Where am I going to eat?
- What things do I need to take with me? 

Such questions represent a gap in knowledge and indicate an insufficient access to information. Travelers want to pick a best place to sleep, choose a restaurant with the tastiest food, or pack the most appropriate clothes. To achieve this, travelers have to find means of acquiring information necessary to bridge the gap between their situation and the desired outcome. In the first situation, prior to traveling, this gap is most often bridged by searching for information online, or asking someone who is familiar with the destination the traveler is visiting. This provides them with the information they need to achieve the outcomes later on when they are in a foreign country. 

Travelers find themselves in different situations at various stages of their journey, and they use different bridges depending on the immediate context. For example, on an airport the desired outcome is finding the right gate and bridge is provided by looking up information on a flight departure display. Or when lost in a foreign city, asking someone on the street for directions serves as a bridge to getting to the desired location. The choice of bridges is thus highly situational and dependent on time and context. Based on this framework, the following two situations were chosen as key for the proposed IS solution:

- Planning a future trip to a foreign country using a desktop computer in a home country.
- Looking up directions to a specific location using a smartphone in a foreign country.

Limiting the number of situations for the proposed IS solution will provide focus, and should make the solution more sensitive to the immediate context of use.


#### Information Needs and Seeking ####
Information Needs and Seeking model is used to examine personal needs in a traveling context, followed by a brief examination of other factors influencing information behavior when traveling.

In his model of Information Needs and Seeking, Wilson (2006) identifies personal needs as a motivator for information seeking behavior. Despite the title of the model, Wilson argues that the term information needs is not adequate and that we instead speak of information seeking towards satisfaction of needs (Wilson, 2006). In this view, information needs are merely a way to conceptualize more basic human needs in relation to information and ways of obtaining it. The basic human needs are: physiological, affective, and cognitive. These needs are closely interrelated. In majority of situations higher-level needs cannot be attained without satisfying lower-level ones (in order they are presented here). However, for the purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that a traveler is in a such life situation that allows him to fulfill all the needs equally.

**Physiological needs**

Physiological needs in the context of travel do not differ significantly from the physiological needs in a home country. People always need food, water, and sheleter, no matter where they are. There is however one factor that seems to change when traveling. Many survey respondents mentioned information about restaurants and eating out as very important when planning a trip. This indicates that when traveling, people might have a higher standard for the quality of food. The same applies to accommodation, where people might expected a higher standard for room tidiness. This signifies that a certain indicator of quality should be included in the proposed IS solution.

**Affective needs**

Affective needs, sometimes called psychological or emotional needs, are hard to grasp because every person has virtually unattainable number of them. Yet, there are some affective needs that are particularly important for the context of travel. The need for enlightenment and cultural self-development was one of the most apparent with the survey's respondents. Many have mentioned that they are interested in finding information about local culture and important historical landmarks. Other needs in this context may include entertainment, being in control, privacy, sense of belonging, security, feeling of competence, and many others. Travelers are going to prioritize those needs differently based on their personal preferences. It can be argued that certain patterns and categories will arise eventually. These patterns could be described using stereotypes like: lone traveler, adventurous traveler, family man, or travel snob. While this list is far from exhaustive, it implies that there are certain themes that reflect certain affective needs. This signifies that the proposed IS solution should incorporate elements that will make it easy to navigate based on themes.

**Cognitive needs**

The most high-level needs are the cognitive needs. Arguably, these needs are even harder to grasp than affective needs. They represent person’s drive to pursue new knowledge, learn new skills, and generally improve their intelligence and cognitive abilities. There were no clear references to cognitive needs in relation to traveling in the survey’s answers. The desire to learn about local landmarks and culture could be included here, but it was deemed more suitable to categorize it as an affective need. Wilson (2006) mentions the need to plan as an example of a cognitive need. It is this need to plan that is used for the subsequent analysis. Which signifies that the proposed IS solution should enable people to plan out their travels.

**Other factors**

In the model Wilson also stresses the importance of various environmental, contextual, personal, and interpersonal factors that affect people’s information behavior. Travelers face many constrains both prior, and after traveling to a foreign country. The most obvious ones are environmental constrains. Time of the year, weather, 




* environmental constraints: time of the year, weather, physical access
* economical constrains: budget, ppl indicated they are looking for cheap places
* kids friendly - social constraints


the takeaway is that the proposed solution needs to accommodate a variety of themes and different way of categorizing and 




### 5.3 Proposed Information System Solution


* address the human-scale

Despite the recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence, humans remain the best curators and interpreters of information (Choo, 2002).

- qualitative judgment performed by humans and quantitative done by a machine 


- “The best information environments do not automate away the human role” (Choo, 2002, p. 50)

- humans are still best curators, not algorithms, therefore the focus is on people creating lists of locations, referred to as guides
- a guide, representing a list of locations, as information item representing local knowledge in an actionable form
not menu driven
- has to be available offline (each favorited/followed list automatically generates a map and info cards that are available offline)
- private/shared/public lists
- gamification, ranking systems

- “Now and in the future, a goal of everyone involved with communicating information must be to move away from presenting text to generating information which leads to knowledge” (Albers, 2008, p. 122)
- “to populate our information spaces with information artefacts that enable and encourage people to understand the activity space.” (Benyon, 2001, p. 429)





#### Tapping into wisdom of crowds

* trust building in a virtual environment (A12)
* simplistic model of motivation (B3:92) -> works fairly well for traditional economy not so much information economy
* social production
* local residents have implicit knowledge of surroundings
* commons based peer production like Wikipedia


#### Business Model

- potential for monetization:
	- charge companies to make accounts (sponsored lists), individual always free
	- create an internal market, where companies motivate opinion leaders to mention them on their list
