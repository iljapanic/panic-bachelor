## 5. Analysis
As stated in the outset of this paper, the tourism industry has been one of  the most impacted by the proliferation of ubiquitous Internet access. The Internet technology increasingly mediates the traveling experience (Xiang, & Gretzel, 2010). While in the past the brands and travel agencies owned the sense of quality, now it is the digital word-of-mouth that decides where people go to eat, sleep and entertain themselves when on the road (Vanderbilt, 2015; Xiang, & Gretzel, 2010).

To guide the analysis, the following research question has been devised (as stated in the Introduction). 

*How to provide travelers with location-based information through harnessing collective knowledge of local residents by applying principles of information design?* 

The following analysis follows a DSRM as outlined in the previous section. It starts off by identifying problems with some of the current solutions. Then it moves onto examining characteristics of a potential solution based on the models identified in the conceptual framework and the collected data. The analysis concludes by proposing a solution to the information problem posed by traveling.


### 5.1 Current solutions
There is no shortage of services and tools that claim to help travelers find useful information, and provide an insight into a local culture. However, from the collected data it was apparent that there are a few prevalent sources of information that people use when they are visiting a foreign country. Following is an analysis of some of those sources, together with others deemed suitable by the author.

#### Search engines (Google)
Google is a dominant source of travel-related information for majority of people (Xiang, & Gretzel, 2010). Several respondents from the survey indicated that they use Google to get a general overview of the location they are traveling to. However, some of those respondents also mentioned that they find Google unsuitable for finding a more specialized and personalized type of information. This information source can be described as **many-to-traveler**, since there is no predominant group that provides the information (if we omit paid search results). Google supports exploratory type of travel research and is a good starting point, but in the words of one of the respondents: “[the] results can be quite overwhelming”.

#### Paper guidebook
A traditional source for travel-related information. Its main advantage is a comprehensive overview of the country’s landmarks, culture, gastronomy, and local manners. However, guidebooks can quickly get outdated due to the limitations of the paper as a medium. This source can be described as **business-to-traveler**, since it is created by a company. This increases a chance of biased content, since other organizations can pay to be included, or prioritized in the guidebook.


#### TripAdvisor
One of the most widely used services for looking up reviews and ratings for restaurants and hotels. It is primarily a **traveler-to-traveler** source. This may result in a diluted type of information, because the majority of the user-generated content is created by tourists, not locals, who are more familiar with genuinely local attractions. Their feedback systems are susceptible to manipulation with a possibility to buy bogus reviews online (Smyth, Wu, & Greene 2010). The interface is menu-driven and the content on the service is curated by an algorithm that is secretive and non-transparent (Vanderbilt, 2015). The service's main advantage is the diversity of opinions and reviews lowering the overall bias. But since the reviews and ratings are bound to a single, isolated attraction, the service runs into a trouble of generating “loads of info, but no insight” (Vanderbilt, 2015).


#### CouchSurfing
The service is not officially portrayed as a travel-related information source. Yet, it provides a **local-to-traveler** type of information exchange, which provides the traveler with most authentic information. However, this exchange happens exclusively through face-to-face communication. The online service serves only as mediator, helping travelers establish a contact with a local host. It does not produce, nor capture any travel-related information artifacts for future reference for other travelers.


### 5.2 Information seeking and traveling

Online search the prevalent method, followed by asking someone you know, with few people using paper guidebooks.

* search is a dominant mode of finding information
* search engines (Google Search) are the gatekeepers, and serve as an entry point to other services
* humans are still the best curators

#### Dervin’s Sense-Making Framework ####
Derwin’s Sense-Making framework is used to situate the traveler in time and space and identify means of resolving information problems they face in relation to the outcomes they expect to achieve. The first situation occurs in traveler’s home country, when they first find out they are going to travel to a foreign country. It is at this point where first information problems arise. Travelers have to ask themselves questions like:

- Where am I going to stay?
- How am I going to get there?
- How much money do I need to take with me?
- Where am I going to eat?
- What things do I need to take with me? 

Such questions represent a gap in knowledge and indicate an insufficient access to information. Travelers want to pick a best place to sleep, choose a restaurant with the tastiest food, or pack the most appropriate clothes. To achieve this, travelers have to find means of acquiring information necessary to bridge the gap between their situation and the desired outcome. In the first situation, prior to traveling, this gap is most often bridged by searching for information online, or asking someone who is familiar with the destination the traveler is visiting. This provides them with the information they need to achieve the outcomes later on when they are in a foreign country. 

Travelers find themselves in different situations at various stages of their journey, and they use different bridges depending on the immediate context. For example, on an airport the desired outcome is finding the right gate and bridge is provided by looking up information on a flight departure display. Or when lost in a foreign city, asking someone on the street for directions serves as a bridge to getting to the desired location. The choice of bridges is thus highly situational and dependent on context. Based on this framework, the following two situations were chosen as key for the proposed solution:

- Planning a future trip to a foreign country using a desktop computer in a home country.
- Looking up directions to a specific location using a smartphone in a foreign country.

Limiting the number of situations for the proposed solution will provide focus, and should make the solution more sensitive to the immediate context of use.


#### Information Needs and Seeking ####
In his model of Information needs and seeking, Wilson (2006) identifies personal needs as a source of information seeking behavior. Despite the title of the model, Wilson argues that the term information needs is not adequate, and that we rather speak of information seeking towards satisfaction of needs (Wilson, 2006). Since information needs are merely a way to conceptualize a more basic human needs in relation to information and ways of obtaining it. Wilson stresses the importance of various environmental, contextual, personal, and interpersonal factors that affect people’s information behavior. In this part of the analysis, personal needs in the context of travel are examined, followed by a brief examination of some of the higher level factors influencing information behavior when traveling.

Physiological needs in the context of travel do not differ significantly from the physiological needs in a home country. People always need food, water, and sheleter, no matter where they are. There is however one factor that seems to change when traveling. Many survey respondents mentioned information about restaurants and eating out as very important when planning a trip. This indicates that when traveling, people might have a higher standard for the quality of food. The same applies to accommodation, where people might expected a higher standard for room tidiness. This signifies that a certain indicator of quality should be included in the proposed solution.

Affective needs, sometimes called psychological or emotional needs, are hard to grasp because every person has virtually unattainable number of them. Yet, there are some affective needs that are particularly important for the context of travel. The need for enlightenment and 


Travelers are going to prioritize those needs differently based on their personal preferences, but certain patterns and regularities will eventually arise. These patterns could be described using 



cognitive needs as a focus -> support planning


* environmental constraints: time of the year, weather, physical access
* economical constrains: budget, ppl indicated they are looking for cheap places
* kids friendly - social constraints

the takeaway is that the proposed solution needs to accommodate a variety of themes and different way of categorizing and 




### 5.3 Proposed Solution


* address the human-scale
* qualitative judgment is handled by IS (algorhytms) not humans (see Cooley 2000, p.66)

- humans are still best curators, not algorithms, therefore the focus is on people creating lists of locations, referred to as guides
- a guide, representing a list of locations, as information item representing local knowledge in an actionable form
not menu driven
- has to be available offline (each favorited/followed list automatically generates a map and info cards that are available offline)
- private/shared/public lists
- gamification, ranking systems

- “Now and in the future, a goal of everyone involved with communicating information must be to move away from presenting text to generating information which leads to knowledge” (Albers, 2008, p. 122)
- “to populate our information spaces with information artefacts that enable and encourage people to understand the activity space.” (Benyon, 2001, p. 429)





#### Tapping into wisdom of crowds

* trust building in a virtual environment (A12)
* simplistic model of motivation (B3:92) -> works fairly well for traditional economy not so much information economy
* social production
* local residents have implicit knowledge of surroundings
* commons based peer production like Wikipedia


#### Business Model

- potential for monetization:
	- charge companies to make accounts (sponsored lists), individual always free
	- create an internal market, where companies motivate opinion leaders to mention them on their list
