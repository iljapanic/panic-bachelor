## 1. INTRODUCTION

> “*Every day, we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data — so much that 90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone.*”

We are drowning in data. We like to talk about information society, but “[m]ost of the technology we call information technology is, in fact, data technology” (Shedroff, 2000, p. 272). The turn of 21st century is characterized by a severe information overload, or rather, a data overload, on both an organizational and personal level (Jones, 2012; Shedroff, 2000). The industry leaders are quick to provide us with new buzzwords like Big Data, Deep Learning, and Internet of Things. Such terms help familiarize the general public with the latest advances in technology, but they are often just new labels for problems that researchers, philosophers, and businesses were trying to address decades ago. These problems have grown in scale and affect more people now than ever before. But the way we approach information and information design has not kept pace with the growing complexity of our information systems.

We may indeed be in the midst of a transition to a true information society, but for the time being, our approach to dealing with information problems is still rooted in the mechanistic, Tayloristic view of optimum organization. Our answer to the ever-increasing  flow of unstructured data and information has been overstructuring (Cooley, 2000). System designers tend to base their decisions on the system's capabilities rather than human needs which the system is supposed to cater for. This leads to bloated multi-purpose solutions that are out of proportion to what the human mind can process in a reasonable and useful manner. By framing people's problems as mere features in vast information systems, we fail to address the more fundamental issues of how people perceive and interact with the information around them on day-to-day basis. We judge the quality of the system by the number of features it has, rather than how it enhances our lives. The field of human-computer interaction (HCI) has emerged to tackle this growing disconnect between the systems and people using those systems.

HCI gained prominence in the early 90’s and its popularity keeps rising to this day. The researchers in this field did succeed in shifting more attention to human actors, however, the concepts and ideas used are still much technocentric. Much of the research in HCI revolves around system capabilities and investigating how people manipulate data through visual interfaces, rather than how they perceive information and how it fits into the broader context of their everyday lives. It tries to extract and objectify universal truths and apply them to the design of interfaces which are usable, but not necessarily useful.

This paper examines the latest approaches to the design of human-centered information systems. These approaches are rooted in an ecological inquiry, investigating people in their natural surroundings, paying particular attention to the context of the information use. These emerging fields see people as an absolute focal point of the study. The underlying technology is of secondary interest. The utility of these post-modern perspectives on information management is illustrated on a design solution for a knowledge-sharing platform. Principles of information design, rather than system design, are applied to conceptualize a possible solution for information problems posed by traveling to a foreign country.

Traveling is an information-intense industry, and has been of the most impacted by the massive proliferation of the Internet and social media in the last decade (Xiang, & Gretzel, 2010). Therefore, it was chosen as a suitable area of interest for this research. Moreover, the choice was motivated by author’s own personal experience with finding and sharing relevant travel information, and a long-term desire to design and develop a platform that would mediate a more authentic traveling experience. To guide the investigation, the following research question has been devised:

*How to provide travelers with location-based information through harnessing collective knowledge of local residents?*

The paper starts off by positioning itself in the multidisciplinary field of information management. Then it goes into examining the terminology and concepts used in the analysis by applying the latest perspectives for the design of human-centered information systems. After that, the methodology and the research design are presented, followed by the analysis itself. The paper concludes with proposing a possible solution to the information problem at hand, and finishes off by summarizing the findings.
