## 1. Introduction

“[O]verload, clutter, and confusion are not attributes of information, they are failures of design.” (Tufte, 2011 as seen in ????)

We are drowning in data. People like to talk about information society, but “[m]ost of the technology we call information technology is, in fact, data technology” (Shedroff, 2000, p. 272). Our modern age is characterized by a severe information overload, or rather, a data overload, on both an organizational and individual level (Jones, 2012; Shedroff, 2000). Aware of this bleak state of affairs, magazine and news articles with titles containing buzzwords like Big Data, or Deep Learning, are basically a daily occurrence.

We may indeed be in a middle of transition to a true information society, but for the time being, our approach to managing information is still very much rooted in mechanistic, Tayloristic view of optimum organization (Cooley, 2000). To cope with the ever-increasing  flow of unstructured data and information, system designers tend to overstructuralize by relying heavily on menu-driven interfaces defined by often arbitrary taxonomies (Cooley, 2000). We merely hide the problem, and fail to address the more fundamental issues of how people perceive and interact with the information around them on daily basis. To address this growing problem, the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) was born.

HCI gained prominence in the early 90’s and its popularity keeps rising to this day. The researchers in this field did succeed in shifting more attention to human actors, however, the concepts and ideas used are still very much technocentric. Much of the research in HCI revolves around system capabilities and investigating how people manipulate data through visual interfaces, rather than how they perceive information and how it fits into the broader context of their everyday lives. It tries to extract and objectify universal truths and apply them to the design of interfaces which are usable, but not necessarily useful.

This paper examines the latest approaches to the design of human-centered information systems. These approaches are rooted in an ecological inquiry, investigating people in their natural surroundings, paying particular attention to the context of the information use. These emerging fields see humans as an absolute focal point of the study; the underlying technology is of secondary interest. To demonstrate the utility of these post-modern perspectives on information management, the principles of information design are applied to conceptualize a possible solution to an information problem in a specific context of travelling.

The traveling is an information-intense industry, and is one of the most impacted by the massive proliferation of the Internet and social media in the last decade (Xiang, & Gretzel, 2010). Therefore, it was chosen as a suitable area of interest for this research. Moreover, the choice was motivated by author’s personal frustration with finding spots populated by locals when travelling, and a long-term intention to design and develop a platform that would mediate a more authentic traveling experience. To guide the investigation, the following research question has been devised:

How to provide travelers with location-based information through harnessing collective knowledge of local residents?

The paper starts off by positioning itself in the multidisciplinary field of information management. Then it goes into examining the terminology and concepts used in the analysis, by applying the latest perspectives for the design of human-centered information systems. After that, the methodology and the research design are presented, followed by the analysis itself. The paper concludes with proposing a possible solution to the information problem at hand, and finishes of by summarizing the findings.
