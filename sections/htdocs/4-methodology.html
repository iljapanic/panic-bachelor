<h2 id="4-methodology">4. Methodology</h2>
<p>This paper takes a naturalistic, discovery-oriented  approach to inquiry which puts “no prior constraints on what the outcomes of the research will be” (Naumer, &amp; Fisher 2007, p. 77). Naturalistic inquiry is holistic and contextual, decoupling research from specific technology, or setting (Naumer, &amp; Fisher 2007). That is not to say, that a specific technology will not be proposed for the design of the IS, or that an actor will not be examined in a specific context. It simply means that analysis, leading to the specific applications, is informed by a broad range of factors which are not concerned with particularities of travel, or a concrete choice of technology.</p>
<p>The pragmatic nature of the research does not lend itself to traditional research methodologies. Therefore, a Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) as proposed by Peffers, Rothenberger, Tuunanen, &amp; Chatterjee (2007) is applied. By applying DSRM, this paper does not try to understand reality, but in a tradition of design science it “attempts to create things that serve human purposes” (Peffers et al., 2007, p. 48). The core principle of this methodology is that it must produce an artefact created to address an observed problem. Production of the artefact is only a third step in the DSRM process. The subsequent demonstration, evaluation, and communication are an integral part of an iterative process to develop and design a satisfactory IS. However, given the scope of this research, the last three stages are omitted, and the focus  is solely on the first three stages. These stages are (in the order they occur in):</p>
<p>Problem identification and motivation. Defining the research problem and justifying the value of designing a solution to that problem.
Define the objectives for a solution. Infer objectives of the IS on which the appropriateness of the designed artifact will be judged. This stage requires knowledge of the state of the problem, and current solutions and their efficacy.
Design and development. Creating an artefact which can take various forms. Conceptually, it can be any designed object in which a research contribution is embedded in the design.</p>
<p>The stages relevant for the purposes of this paper are highlighted in Figure 9, together with a problem-centered point of entry.</p>

<h3 id="4-1-data-collection">4.1 Data collection</h3>
<p>This paper represents the initial stage of a more long-term project to design a knowledge-sharing platform for travellers. The primary goal of the research presented here is to set a solid theoretical framework for future research. Therefore, primary data utilized in this paper is based on an existing research into human-centered approaches to IS design. This primary data is supplemented with secondary, empirical data based on exploratory interviews and an online questionnaire. The naturalistic and pragmatic approach to the inquiry naturally lends itself to qualitative data. Quantitative data is seen as way to objectify a complex reality and is deemed unsuitable for the purposes of this research. </p>
<p>The first set of empirical data was collected through an unstructured, exploratory interviews with students at the premises of Copenhagen Business School in Copenhagen, Denmark. A total of six people were interviewed, three individually, and three as a part of a group conversation. There were no assumptions or hypothesis prior to these interviews. The purpose was to get an overall idea of how people perceive their habits when it comes to finding information when travelling. Certain commonalities were identified, which served as foundation for creating an online questionnaire. Since the goal was to obtain qualitative data, the questionnaire was comprising of a very small number of open-ended questions. The questionnaire utilized a “logical jumps” feature, which determined the type of questions being asked based on the answer from the first question. By dividing the questionnaire into several logical branches, it was possible to have questions that asked the respondents to compare and contrast the different methods they use to look for travel-related information (the shortest path comprised of two questions, the longest of six). The design of the questionnaire relied heavily on people’s willingness to type out their answers, so there were instances where the respondents skipped all the open-ended questions and answered only the first one, used to determine which logical branch to present. However, the majority of respondents filled out all the questions, some with simple keywords, others with concise paragraphs of text. There was a total of 31 respondents, with an average of 6 minutes and 1 second spent on completing the questionnaire. To the author’s own surprise, the quality of the obtained data was relatively high. The commonalities identified in the initial interviews were further established and expanded on, and new ones were identified. </p>
