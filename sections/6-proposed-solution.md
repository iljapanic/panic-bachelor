## 6. Proposed solution

- humans are still best curators, not algorithms, therefore the focus is on people creating lists of locations, referred to as guides
- a guide, representing a list of locations, as information item representing local knowledge in an actionable form
not menu driven
- has to be available offline (each favorited/followed list automatically generates a map and info cards that are available offline)
- private/shared/public lists
- gamification, ranking systems
- potential for monetization:
	- charge companies to make accounts (sponsored lists), individual always free
	- create an internal market, where companies motivate opinion leaders to mention them on their list
- “Now and in the future, a goal of everyone involved with communicating information must be to move away from presenting text to generating information which leads to knowledge” (Albers, 2008, p. 122)
- “to populate our information spaces with information artefacts that enable and encourage people to understand the activity space.” (Benyon, 2001, p. 429)
