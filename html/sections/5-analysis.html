<h2 id="5-analysis">5. Analysis</h2>
<p>As stated in the outset of this paper, the tourism industry has been one of  the most impacted by the proliferation of ubiquitous Internet access. The Internet technology increasingly mediates the traveling experience (Xiang, &amp; Gretzel, 2010). While in the past the brands owned the sense of quality, now it is the digital word-of-mouth that decides where people go to eat, sleep and entertain themselves when on the road (Vanderbilt, 2015; Xiang, &amp; Gretzel, 2010).</p>
<p>To guide the analysis, the following research question has been devised (as stated in the Introduction). </p>
<p><em>How to provide travelers with location-based information through harnessing collective knowledge of local residents?</em> </p>
<p>The following analysis follows a DSRM as outlined in the previous section. It starts off by identifying a problem with the current solutions. Then it moves onto examining characteristics of a potential solution based on the models identified in the conceptual framework. The analysis concludes by proposing a solution to the information problem posed by traveling.</p>
<h3 id="5-1-current-solutions">5.1 Current solutions</h3>
<p>There is no shortage of services and tools that claim to help travelers find useful information, and provide an insight into a local culture. However, from the collected data it was apparent that there are only a few prevalent source of information that people use when they are visiting a foreign country. Following is an analysis of some of those services, together with others deemed suitable by the author.</p>
<h4 id="paper-guidebooks">Paper guidebooks</h4>
<ul>
<li>gets outdated quickly</li>
<li>strong bias (business paying to be featured)</li>
<li>great source for general info about the country, local culture and manners</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TripAdvisor (T2T, B2T)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>feedback systems susceptible to manipulation (Smyth, Wu, &amp; Greene 2010)</li>
<li>curated by algorithm, which is secretive and non-transparent (Vanderbilt, 2015)</li>
<li>menu-driven interface</li>
<li>“loads of info, but no insight” (Vanderbilt, 2015)</li>
<li>built around businesses, not people</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CouchSurfing (T2L)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>primary happening in the real world, online platform serves only as a mediator before the face-to-face contact with the host is established</li>
<li>requires a particular worldview</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-2-information-seeking-in-the-travel">5.2 Information-seeking in the travel</h3>
<ul>
<li>humans are still the best curators</li>
<li>address the human-scale</li>
<li>qualitative judgment is handled by IS (algorhytms) not humans (see Cooley 2000, p.66)</li>
<li>search is a dominant mode of finding information</li>
<li>search engines (Google Search) are the gatekeepers, and serve as an entry point to other services</li>
<li>environmental constraints: time of the year, weather, physical access</li>
<li>economical constrains: budget</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-3-proposed-solution">5.3 Proposed Solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>humans are still best curators, not algorithms, therefore the focus is on people creating lists of locations, referred to as guides</li>
<li>a guide, representing a list of locations, as information item representing local knowledge in an actionable form
not menu driven</li>
<li>has to be available offline (each favorited/followed list automatically generates a map and info cards that are available offline)</li>
<li>private/shared/public lists</li>
<li><p>gamification, ranking systems</p>
</li>
<li><p>“Now and in the future, a goal of everyone involved with communicating information must be to move away from presenting text to generating information which leads to knowledge” (Albers, 2008, p. 122)</p>
</li>
<li>“to populate our information spaces with information artefacts that enable and encourage people to understand the activity space.” (Benyon, 2001, p. 429)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tapping-into-wisdom-of-crowds">Tapping into wisdom of crowds</h4>
<ul>
<li>trust building in a virtual environment (A12)</li>
<li>simplistic model of motivation (B3:92) -&gt; works fairly well for traditional economy not so much information economy</li>
<li>social production</li>
<li>local residents have implicit knowledge of surroundings</li>
<li>commons based peer production like Wikipedia</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="business-model">Business Model</h4>
<ul>
<li>potential for monetization:<ul>
<li>charge companies to make accounts (sponsored lists), individual always free</li>
<li>create an internal market, where companies motivate opinion leaders to mention them on their list</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
