<h2 id="6-proposed-solution">6. Proposed solution</h2>
<ul>
<li>humans are still best curators, not algorithms, therefore the focus is on people creating lists of locations, referred to as guides</li>
<li>a guide, representing a list of locations, as information item representing local knowledge in an actionable form
not menu driven</li>
<li>has to be available offline (each favorited/followed list automatically generates a map and info cards that are available offline)</li>
<li>private/shared/public lists</li>
<li>gamification, ranking systems</li>
<li>potential for monetization:<ul>
<li>charge companies to make accounts (sponsored lists), individual always free</li>
<li>create an internal market, where companies motivate opinion leaders to mention them on their list</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“Now and in the future, a goal of everyone involved with communicating information must be to move away from presenting text to generating information which leads to knowledge” (Albers, 2008, p. 122)</li>
<li>“to populate our information spaces with information artefacts that enable and encourage people to understand the activity space.” (Benyon, 2001, p. 429)</li>
</ul>
