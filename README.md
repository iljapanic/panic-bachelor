# panic-bachelor

This is an experiment in writing a bachelor project using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), creating a platform-independent format for academic papers using openly available tools. 

The idea is to create a sustainable pattern for academic writing that is compatible with the Web, while staying entirely focused on the writing experience using your favorite distraction-free editor.

This is a living document. Expect things to be added and deleted abruptly. Who knows, you may even live long enough to see a finished, well-documented project one day.

If you have any questions, or comments (both to writing and code) don't hesitate to get in touch with [me](http://iljapanic.me).


## Dependencies

- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - converts Markdown to HTML, takes care of all the Web-related stuff
- [Prince](http://www.princexml.com/) - generates a PDF from HTML
- [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) - generates Word document (sigh) from HTML
